# DOM Fader

Add a subtle fade-in/fade-out effect when accessing or navigating into a website.

Inspired by Christopher Aue's article [How To Fade Web Pages On Load And Unload (CSS + JS)](https://christopheraue.net/design/fading-pages-on-load-and-unload).


## Installation

Just add the content of [fader.htm](./fader.htm) directly after the body tag in your layout.
This one-liner will add the necessary elements to your webpage, inject some CSS, and attach the events.
